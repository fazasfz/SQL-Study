A Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL is a temporary result set that you can reference within a 
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs are defined using the WITH keyword, 
and they can make complex queries easier to write, understand, and maintain by breaking them into simpler parts.

--Example 2 :

with Test_CTE as (
select employeeid,firstname from #temp1 where EmployeeID in (2,4)

--Example 3

with [Comm Table Expression] as (
select * from #temp1 where EmployeeID in (1,2,3)
)

select * into #temp2 from [Comm Table Expression]

select * from #temp2

--Example 4 :

)
